A front-end to the Serials Solutions OpenURL XML API.  The front-end provides the following features:

1)  Login - validates user name and password for registered users.  Users who are not currently registered are offered the opportunity to create a new user account.
2)  "Forgot your password" function - sends the stored password to the stored e-mail address.
3)  Validation - in order to access the API, a user must be affiliated with an institutional customer who has an active subscription to the correct service.  In addition, a signed XML API non-disclosure agreement must be on record for the institution with which the user is affiliated.  Users who do not satisfy these conditions are not given access to the API, but are presented with account representative contact information instead.

Tables/models:
	a)  Customers table. Tracks core institutional information as well as whether or not a non-disclosure agreement has been signed on behalf of the institution.
	b)  Users table.  Login and password info for all registered users, each of whom must be affiliated with one (and only one) customer institution.
	c)  Subscriptions table.  Tracks all types of available subscriptions to services.
